# PY133
Lab material for PHY133

procedure:
1. check the manual: find out the z of LCR curcuit and complex impedence. 
2. measure the actually resistance of te resistor box and make a chart of it. (see .csv)
3. connect the DC source, oscilloscope, resistor box, the the unknown box as the figure shows. 
4. now the CH1 = Voltage across the unknown box and CH2 = Votage across the resistor box = I(t)R. 
5. make sure to invert CH2
6. vary f=10~100k in step of 20. (see notebook file)
7. record f, CH1, CH2, phaseCH1, and calculate impedence z = CH1 R / CH2
8. get extra data points if find resonance. 
9. z = V_1R/(-V_2) = abs(V_1)R/abs(-V_2) exp(iùõø)
10. plot frequency vs. impedence and frequency vs. phase
